# List of spawn events for this level.
SpawnEvents:
  # --- Spawn Event 1 ---
  - Time: 5000                # Time (in milliseconds) after level start when this event triggers.
    Enabled: true             # Whether this spawn event is enabled (true/false).
    Count: 100                # Number of formations to spawn (not individual enemies).
                              # Total enemies = Count × (Width × Height) for "Rectangle" formations.

    # Spawn position: a fixed point or a random range.
    # Position: { X: 0.75, Y: 0.1 }                 # (Example: spawn at a fixed point)
    Position: { Min: { X: 0.0, Y: 0.0 }, Max: { X: 1.0, Y: 0.0 } }  # Random spawn along the top edge (X from 0.0 to 1.0, Y = 0.0).

    IntervalMs: 1000           # Interval in milliseconds between individual spawns within this event (if Count > 1).

    # Formation parameters:
    #   Type:      Shape of the formation ("Rectangle", "Triangle", "Circle").
    #   Width:     Number of enemies per row (for Rectangle).
    #   Height:    Number of rows (for Rectangle).
    #   Solid:     Whether the formation is solid (true) or hollow (false).
    #   Spacing:   Distance between enemies in pixels (X and Y).
    # To spawn a single enemy, use Type: "Rectangle", Width: 1, Height: 1.
    # Spacing values are in raw pixels (not relative to screen size).
    Formation: { Type: "Rectangle", Width: 1, Height: 1, Solid: true, Spacing: { X: 50, Y: 50 } }

    Behavior: "None"           # (Reserved for future use; not implemented yet)
